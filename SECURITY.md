# Security & Licensing Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately via a [GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/jgsystemsconsulting/jgs-med-device-knowledge-packs/security/advisories/new),
or open a pull request with the fix. Please do **not** open a public issue for a
security report. If neither route works for you, `support@jgsystemsconsulting.com`
is the org's shared, monitored support inbox.

- Include a description, affected files/packs, and reproduction steps.
- Expect an acknowledgement within **5 working days**.
- Please allow private disclosure: give us a reasonable window to remediate before any
  public discussion.

This is open-source software provided under the MIT licence (tooling) with no warranty.
There is **no bug-bounty programme**; reports are handled on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a licensing concern

This catalogue's integrity depends on every pack being lawfully redistributable. If you
believe a pack misrepresents its source's licence, includes Excluded-source material, or
otherwise should not be redistributed, report it to the same address with the `licensing`
subject line. **Licensing reports are triaged first:** we would rather pull a pack than
ship one that should not be redistributed. See [docs/SOURCE-VETTING.md](docs/SOURCE-VETTING.md)
and [docs/LICENSING.md](docs/LICENSING.md).

## Scope

Packs are plain Markdown and the tooling is stdlib Python; there is no runtime server,
network service, or credential handling in this repository.

## Accepted risks

Accepted security risks are recorded below as record-keeping entries as they are
accepted; they do not change the reporting policy above.
