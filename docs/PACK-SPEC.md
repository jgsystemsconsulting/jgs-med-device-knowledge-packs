# Pack Specification

A **knowledge pack** is a self-contained, installable agent skill built from one vetted
open source. It follows the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills)
`SKILL.md` convention, so it loads in Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Amp without
modification.

## Required layout (content packs)

```
packs/<slug>/
├── SKILL.md          # REQUIRED. Always-loaded index: frontmatter + core frameworks
│                     #   + chapter index + topic index. Keep body < ~4,000 tokens.
├── PACK.yaml         # REQUIRED. Provenance + licence metadata (schema below).
├── LICENSE           # REQUIRED. Reproduces the SOURCE's licence/terms.
├── chapters/         # REQUIRED. On-demand chapter files, chNN-<slug>.md.
│   └── chNN-*.md     #   Loaded only when a topic routes to them (progressive disclosure).
├── glossary.md       # optional: key terms, alphabetical, with chapter refs.
├── patterns.md       # optional: concrete techniques (when to use / how / trade-offs).
└── cheatsheet.md     # optional: decision rules, selection tables, tells & smells.
```

## `SKILL.md` rules

- **YAML frontmatter** with `name` (= folder slug) and a `description` that states what
  the pack covers **and its scope limits** (be honest about what the source is thin on).
- Body order: most important first (hosts truncate from the end on compaction).
  - `## When to use` (immediately followed by a `**Prerequisites:**` line naming what
    the reader should already have/know; enforced by tooling/check_release.py)
  - `## How to Use This Skill`
  - `## Core Frameworks & Mental Models` (~2,000 tokens: the toolkit, not a summary)
  - `## Chapter Index` (table linking every `chapters/chNN-*.md`)
  - `## Topic Index` (alphabetical term → chapter routing: this is how the agent
    navigates)
  - `## Supporting Files`
  - `## Scope & Limits` (what the pack does *not* cover; which source version)
- Every `chapters/` link in the index must resolve to a real file (CI checks this).

## Chapter file rules

Reference-depth structure (prose bodies of knowledge): `Core Idea`, `Frameworks
Introduced`, `Key Concepts`, `Mental Models`, `Anti-patterns` (if any), `Key Takeaways`,
`Connects To`. Ground every claim in the source slice. **Do not invent frameworks the
source does not contain.** Synthesize compactly; never copy long verbatim passages
(both a quality rule and a licence-safety rule).

## `PACK.yaml` schema

```yaml
slug: <first-pack>                 # folder name, kebab-case
title: "[exact source title]"
publisher: "[publisher / rights holder]"
source_version: "[version (date)]"
license: "[the SOURCE licence, verbatim name]"
license_tier: 2                    # 1 | 2 | 3  (see docs/SOURCE-VETTING.md)
commercial_use: false              # false if NC; true if PD or non-NC
share_alike: true                  # true if SA: pack content inherits the licence
attribution_required: true
build:
  method: "[extraction + generation method used]"
  source_pages: <NNN>
  chapters: <NNN>
  built_on: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
notes: >
  Example: a CC BY-NC-SA source yields a pack released under the same licence as the
  source, not the repo's MIT. Non-commercial; attribution and share-alike carried
  forward.
```

`title`, `publisher`, `license`, `license_tier`, and `commercial_use` are **mandatory**
and checked by `tooling/validate_pack.py`. `license_tier` must be 1, 2, or 3, never the
Excluded tier. **No `source_url` / source-material link is stored or published.** The
source is identified textually (title + publisher + version), and `publisher` carries the
attribution, per the no-source-link policy in [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).

## Installing a pack (end user)

```bash
# Claude Code: clone the whole repo, symlink/copy the pack into your skills dir:
git clone https://github.com/jgsystemsconsulting/jgs-med-device-knowledge-packs.git
cp -r jgs-med-device-knowledge-packs/packs/<first-pack> ~/.claude/skills/<first-pack>
# then in a session:  /<first-pack> <topic>
```

(A future `tooling/install.py <slug>` will automate per-pack install across hosts.)

## Validation

```bash
python tooling/validate_pack.py packs/<slug>
```

Member kinds (`kind:` in SKILL.md frontmatter):

| Kind | Members | Requires | Skips |
|---|---|---|---|
| content pack (default) | the catalogue's content packs | Full layout above: `LICENSE` reproducing the source's terms and `chapters/` with at least one chapter | Nothing |
| `signpost` | sector signpost packs (e.g. `packs/<domain>-signpost`) | `SKILL.md` + `PACK.yaml`, all remaining checks | The `LICENSE` and `chapters/` checks (citation-only, zero reproduced content) |
| `orchestrator` | `packs/med` | `SKILL.md` + `PACK.yaml`, all remaining checks | The `LICENSE` and `chapters/` checks (routes to packs, no source content). Its `SKILL.md` body carries the whole routing map and ships in every transform prompt, so it is reviewed against a 24,000-byte ceiling (a review criterion, not a gate). |

Checks: required files present, frontmatter valid, every chapter link resolves,
`PACK.yaml` mandatory fields filled, and `license_tier ∈ {1,2,3}`. CI runs this on
every pack on every PR.
