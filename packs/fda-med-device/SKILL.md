# FDA Device Software Guidance and the QMSR
**Source**: U.S. FDA (CDRH/CBER), 13-source reference set: twelve guidance and rule documents S1-S12 plus the FDA QMSR overview page S4a, dated 2002-01-11 to 2026-02-03, pinned 2026-09-24 | **Licence**: Public Domain (US Government work, 17 U.S.C. 105) | **Chapters**: 12

## When to use
**Prerequisites:** none: plain Markdown; no MCP server, API key, or licence tier needed at runtime.

Use this skill for US FDA questions about software in or around medical devices: what documentation a premarket submission needs, how software must be validated, what the Quality Management System Regulation requires after the 2026-02-02 transition, what cybersecurity artifacts FDA expects, where a software function stops being a device (clinical decision support, MDDS), when a software change triggers a new 510(k), and how eSTAR structures the submission. The pack answers with FDA's own frameworks, cited by chapter and source row.

## How to Use This Skill
- **Without arguments**: read the Core Frameworks below, covering documentation levels, validation vs assurance, the QMSR transition, the SBOM and 524B obligations, and the 510(k) change trigger.
- **With a topic**: use the Topic Index to find the chapter, then ask directly (e.g. "what documentation level applies for this device", "does this OTS library need enhanced testing").
- **With a chapter**: ch01 orientation; ch02-ch04 documentation and assurance; ch05-ch07 QMSR and cybersecurity; ch08-ch09 scope boundaries and the cybersecurity submission package; ch10-ch12 changes, CDS, and eSTAR.

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### Documentation Level: Basic vs Enhanced (S1)
The 2023 premarket software guidance sets a two-value axis, the **Documentation Level**, picked by a risk-based determination rather than a concern-classification scheme. **Enhanced Documentation** applies where a failure or flaw of any device software function could present a hazardous situation with a probable risk of death or serious injury, to a patient, a user, or others in the environment of use; **Basic Documentation** applies everywhere Enhanced does not. The determination weighs all known and foreseeable software hazards, including those from reasonably foreseeable misuse and from cybersecurity compromises, assessed before risk controls are applied and in the context of the device's intended use; the level reflects the device as a whole, not one function in isolation. Enhanced adds submission depth: fuller development, configuration-management and maintenance practices, richer testing and V&V evidence, software version history, and unresolved-anomaly disclosure. A Class III device or a combination-product constituent part defaults to Enhanced; arguing down to Basic takes a documented rationale, and FDA can still ask for more during review. The mental model: two levels, one question ("could this software fail into death or serious injury before risk controls?"), and the answered level is a floor, not a ceiling.

### Software validation principles (S2)
The General Principles of Software Validation frame validation as **confirmation by objective evidence** that software conforms to its specifications and that those specifications match user needs and intended use. Validation spans the whole lifecycle, not a final test phase; changes after initial validation get their own validation effort scaled to the change; and the independence of review scales with risk. One boundary matters for reading everything else: Section 6 of this guidance (validation of automated process equipment and quality system software) is superseded by the CSA guidance (S3), while the rest remains the authority for device software.

### Computer Software Assurance: risk-based validation (S3)
CSA replaces check-the-box computer system validation for **production and quality management system software** with a risk-based method: establish the intended use of the system, determine the risk its failure poses to product quality or safety, and select assurance activities proportionate to that risk. Testing becomes one tool among several, and **unscripted** approaches (ad-hoc, error-guessing, exploratory) are legitimate where risk allows. The record documents intended use, the risk determination, the assurance activities chosen and why, and the results. The mental model: assurance follows risk, and the record shows the reasoning, not just a test log.

### The QMSR transition (S4, S4a, S5)
The 2024 final rule (89 FR 7496) retitled 21 CFR part 820 from Quality System Regulation to **Quality Management System Regulation** and rewrote it around **ISO 13485:2016 incorporated by reference**, with ISO 9000:2015 clause 3 vocabulary alongside, effective 2026-02-02. FDA kept additions where ISO 13485 alone would fall short of US requirements. The working habit this pack teaches: locate the obligation in ISO 13485 by clause number, then check the rule text (S4, S5) for the FDA-specific layer on top. ISO text itself stays out of this pack; the chapters restate obligations in FDA's words.

### Cybersecurity: the SPDF, SBOM and section 524B (S6)
FDA expects a **secure product development framework (SPDF)**: cybersecurity risk management, security architecture, and cybersecurity testing woven through design, production, and postmarket rather than bolted on at the end. Premarket submissions carry a **software bill of materials (SBOM)**: the software components the device contains, so vulnerabilities can be traced later. FD&C Act section 524B makes "cyber devices" carry standing duties: a postmarket **Cybersecurity Management Plan**, and software updates and patches for known unacceptable vulnerabilities on a reasonable timeline. The mental model: the submission is the opening position of a maintenance commitment, not a one-time disclosure.

### The 510(k) change trigger (S9)
Software changes to an existing device run through a **decision sequence**, not a gut call: what does the change touch, does it alter functionality or performance, does it introduce or shift risk, does labelling change. Answers route to either a new 510(k) or a documented decision to stay put. Both outcomes are recorded; the no-submission decision carries its own rationale. The mental model: every change is presumed to need assessment, and the flowchart is how you prove you did it.

### Scope boundaries: CDS, MDDS and OTS (S7, S10, S8)
Three carve-outs and one category shape what counts as regulated device software. **Clinical decision support** stays outside the device definition when it meets four statutory criteria, including that the clinician can independently review the basis for the recommendation (S7). **MDDS** and image storage/communication functions were moved outside the device definition by the 21st Century Cures Act because they transfer or store data without modifying it (S10). **Off-the-shelf software** inside a device stays fully in scope: its failure modes, the verification evidence proportionate to its risk, and its maintenance and obsolescence plan are all FDA's business (S8). The mental model: first ask "is this a device function at all", then ask "whose software is it".

### eSTAR submissions (S11, S12)
The electronic Submission Template And Repository (eSTAR) structures 510(k) and De Novo submissions as guided PDF templates with mandatory sections and internal checks. eSTAR 510(k)s became mandatory 2023-10-01; eSTAR De Novos from 2025-10-01. The templates change authoring mechanics: content lands in fixed sections, and software and cybersecurity artifacts have designated homes.

## Scope & Limits

**Covers**: US FDA regulation of software in and around medical devices, as stated in the thirteen pinned sources: premarket pathways and submission content, software documentation levels, validation and computer software assurance, the QMSR, device cybersecurity, software-function scope boundaries (CDS, MDDS), off-the-shelf software, the 510(k) change trigger, and eSTAR.

**Does not cover**: EU MDR, UKCA, or any non-US regime (a med-device-eu pack is planned; nothing in this pack answers EU questions). No text from ISO 13485, ISO 9000, ISO 14971, or IEC 62304: those standards are named and their obligations summarized only as FDA states them. No drug, biologic, or combination-product rules, and no FDA enforcement policy beyond what the pinned documents state.

**Not legal advice.** The pack is synthesized reference notes reconstructed from the sources, with quotations capped at two sentences. It is not a substitute for the guidance documents themselves, not regulatory counsel, and not a compliance determination. FDA guidance contains nonbinding recommendations; the rule text and regulations are the binding layer.

**Source dates**: pinned 2026-09-24, documents dated 2002-01-11 to 2026-02-03, with the eCFR part 820 text current as of 2026-09-22. Later FDA actions, draft guidances, and docket activity after the pin date are out of scope. Check fda.gov for current versions before relying on any single requirement.

**Licence & attribution**: public domain (US Government work, 17 U.S.C. 105); FDA is credited as a courtesy in the repository NOTICE, not as a legal obligation, and does not endorse this pack.
